# CodeMirror Plus:

The package provides:
- Additional addons
- Extensions to standard addons
- Addon `builder` that provides convenient utilities to create CodeMirror with a rich set of pre-defined options enabled. See [demo](demo/builder_with_requirejs.html) on how to utilize the package.

The directory structure mirrors the main CodeMirror code base.
